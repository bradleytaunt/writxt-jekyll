# Writxt Jekyll Theme

The official Jekyll theme for the SMS-based blogging platform Writxt.

### Initial Setup
1. Pull / fork this repo
2. Run `bundle install`
3. To run locally: `bundle exec jekyll serve`

That's it!

## Getting Started
Simply following the instructions on the official Writxt project page: [https://writxt.fun](https://writxt.fun)

### Editing Navigation
Edit navigation links inside the `_includes/header.html` template.

### Editing Pagination
By default, the theme sets the posts per page to `10`. Simply change this inside the `_config.yml` file to suit your needs.

### Other Changes
Everything else should follow the standard Jekyll template practices. If you're use to Jekyll, you should have no problems here!
